Subres
======

LTR subtitles plugin for Plex Media Server

The purpose of Subres is to support LTR (Left to Right) languages subtitles with Plex when using a TV (or any other device) that doesn't support LTR by default
This is done by:
  1. Converting the subtitle (SRT) file to Unicode in case it is in ASCII (assuming the TV supports Unicode)
  2. Reversing the characters in the subtitle file since usually when the TV doesn't support LTR the subtitles are rendered reversed on the screen.
  
* This plugin was tested with LG 47LM7600
